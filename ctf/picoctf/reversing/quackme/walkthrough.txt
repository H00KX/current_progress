Hints:
	Find where your input goes


Concepts -- 

memset 
fill memory with a constant byte
https://www.tutorialspoint.com/c_standard_library/c_function_memset.htm

void *memset(void *str, int c, size_t n) copies the character c (an unsigned char) to the first n characters of the string pointed to, by the argument str.
Example:

	






var_14 -- [local_14h]
var_10 -- [local_10h]



local_1ch = ebp + 0x1c

he breaks down what the program is doing -- strategy of finding critical lines of code and reversing 
https://github.com/PlatyPew/picoctf-2018-writeup/tree/master/Reversing/quackme
	He looks at the final check that needs to be met in order to reach "You are winner"
		 cmp dword [local_1ch], 0x19 --- ebp + 0x1c must be equal to 0x19.
	




address of the string saved in var_14
	call sym.read_input
	mov dword [local_14h], eax

length of string is being saved to var_10
	call sym.imp.strlen        
	add esp, 0x10
	mov dword [local_10h], eax
	mov eax, dword [local_10h]

Memset 
	local_1ch
local_18h
