Problem PNG cant open:

Tried to open: Fatal error reading PNG image file: Not a PNG file

Current file:
flag.png: JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01
Current magic number is ff d8 which is for a JPEG file


However, a PNG magic number is 89 50 4E 47 .PNG 




I need to modify the header so that it has the magic number of the PNG file. 

Used Vim as hex editor to change file header to correct magic numbers:
%!xxd -- convert binary to hexdump
%!xxd -r  -- convert hexdump into binary
set binary


original:                                                        
00000000: ffd8 ffe0 0010 4a46 4946 0001 0101 004b  ......JFIF    

changed headerfile: 
00000000: 8950 4e47 0d0a 1a0a 4946 0001 0101 004b  .PNG....IF.....K 

But i get an error when attempting to open the file:
Fatal error reading PNG image file: [01][01][00]K: invalid chunk type

I thought the 8 byte file signature 8950 4e47 0d0a 1a0a was all that was needed for PNG file to work. 
But a PNG subatomic structure has three chunks: image header chunk, IHDR, IDAT, and IEND. 




-----
REMOVING PNG file extension makes it work-- solution
extensions are a lie--- it was a jpeg file with a png 
it was a jpeg file with the wrong extension -- the magic number should have told me it should have been with a jpeg extension

if you change the extension to .jpeg, it also works
