#When commenting out a line in ~/.radare2rc , dont do #foo . Use # foo . That space is important
#Change your fortune type
e cfg.fortunes.type = nsfw
#Disassemble in intel syntax
e asm.syntax = intel
# Use UTF-8 to show cool arrows that do not look like crap :)
e scr.utf8 = true
# Show comments at right of disassembly if they fit in screen 
e asm.cmt.right=true
#Shows pseudocode in disassembly. Eg mov eax, str.ok = > eax = str.ok
#e asm.pseudo = true
#inline description of that each line does.
e asm.describe = true
#Solarized theme
eco solarized
#enable command autocompletion
e cfg.newtab = 1

To set break points in R2
	-- Need to run in ("debug mode") 
	r2 -d program
	otherwise, you will get--- "cannot place a breakpoint on unmapped memory"


Highlighted features of R2 for the purpose of Reversing and Binary Exploitation 

Search for string in binary using r2
	https://radare.gitbooks.io/radare2book/search_bytes/basic_searches.html


Mapping Files
	https://radare.gitbooks.io/radare2book/basic_commands/mapping_files.html
	https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/memory/file-mapping
Purpose
	Maps will put a specific region of an fd in virtual addressing
	mapping the file is required for manipulating a loaded binary file 

Command to map file blah in R2 
:>oo+
:> o
3 * rwx 0x00002450 blah

Example where file mapping matters
	0x0040070a]> wa mov dword [rbp-0x4], 0xdfa8fc77
	Failed to write  -----
	[0x0040070a]> oo+
	[0x0040070a]> wa mov dword [rbp-0x4], 0xdfa8fc77
	Written 7 byte(s) (mov dword [rbp-0x4], 0xdfa8fc77) = wx c745fc77fca8df
	[0x0040070a]> 


Seeking
https://radare.gitbooks.io/radare2book/basic_commands/seeking.html
	Purpose 
		Seek to a different place by changing the current offset
	
	Examples 
		Print current address:
			s
		Seek to an address:
			 s 0x0040070a

Print Modes
https://radare.gitbooks.io/radare2book/basic_commands/print_modes.html
	Purpose 
		Display and interpret information
		Print information that was seeked 
	Examples
		pd[?] [sz] [a] [b]       disassemble N opcodes (pd) or N bytes (pD)
				

Writing Data
https://radare.gitbooks.io/radare2book/basic_commands/write.html
	Purpose 
		

 	Examples:
		Writing the opcode mov from the current offset and moving a memory address into a variable
			wa mov dword [rbp-0x4], 0xdfa8fc77


Managing Variables 
https://radare.gitbooks.io/radare2book/analysis/variables.html
	Purpose
