Preliminary work
	rabin2 -I --- extracting information from binary files
	find strings
		iz
		

	continue the execution process until main is reached. 
		[0xf7797b30]> dcu main

Begining Steps
	ood -- to reopen binary in debug mode to write and modify 
	afll -- to see functions in program 
	afvd -- view local variables

	s @ (address of function) + pdf 
 	afvn [new_name] ([old_name])  rename argument/local -- neccisary to seek to function where you are changing local variable
	

Flags
	Purpose 
		Find interesting offsets associated with Sections, Function, Symbols, Strings,--- more useful than iz
		
axt -- recursive analysis 
	Purpose 
		find data/code references to this address	

	Examples
		axF [flg-glob]  find data/code references of flags
		axt [addr]      find data/code references to this address		




debugging using visual mode -- goal is to registers and local variables on display while stepping through the program like PEDA 
https://rada.re/get/RadareAZ-NN2015.pdf
http://faydoc.tripod.com/cpu/jae.htm -- jmp conditions
	commands to debug 
		Seek to PC (.) -- important to go back to eip when seek doesnt work
		Step (s) or StepOver (S)
		s- undo seek
		add comment: ;
		remove comment: ;-
		dereference memory adddress to pring string --> ps @ memory address 
		afvd -- get values of local variables
		afvn new old @ address -- change variable name 
		ps @ address --  print string
		pf s @ address --  32bit pointer to string  ---- **
     		pf p @ address - pointer reference
		pf i @ addres --   %%i signed integer value (4 bytes) (see %%d and %%x)
		dr -- values of registers-- not particularly useful since using visual mode to debug		
		see register changes --- drd		
		dts+  --- program state at point for recording 
		agf --- graph function currently in function being disassembled 	

	Restart the debugger when it segfaults 
		ood --- restart the execution while attaching the debugger.



Adding meta data to binary 
https://radare.gitbooks.io/radare2book/disassembling/adding_metadata.html
	Annotating and saving changes to binary 
		Using radare project for debugging? 

jumps if the counter is Jump if above or equal jumps if strlen of string_mem local arg is above or equal to


		Saving project 
			Ps <my_project> // to save my comments; the rename of function
		Open the project file 
			r2 -p prj myfile
			you dont need to specify the file again when you are loading the project. so r2 -p prj is enough
		Find Projects 
			Within Radare2
				Po <project>
			Outside of Radare2 
				radare2 -p <my_project>
		debug project
			radare -p <my_project> -d

	
Static Analysis
	You need to seek to function to add meta data/comments --- pdf doesnt work, only seek to address then pd (disassemble)
	remove comment  --> CC- @ address
	add comment --> CC comment @  address	
	edit comment -->  CC! @ address    
	






Visual Graph Mode
	https://gist.github.com/williballenthin/6857590dab3e2a6559d7
	http://radare.today/posts/awesome-ascii-graphs/
	https://www.linuxdays.cz/2017/video/Tomas_Antecky-Disassembling_with_radare2.pdf
	Graph a specific function 
	 ex. VV @ sym.do_magic
	
	Understanding Graph
		-t/f follows conditional jump
		-tab/TAB cycles between nodes	
		-y/Y folds current node	







Highlighted features of R2 for the purpose of Reversing and Binary Exploitation 

	Search for string in binary using r2

Dynamic Analysis 



Mapping Files
https://radare.gitbooks.io/radare2book/basic_commands/mapping_files.html
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/memory/file-mapping
	Purpose
		Maps will put a specific region of an fd in virtual addressing
		mapping the file is required for manipulating a loaded binary file 

	Examples 
		Command to map file blah in R2 
		:>oo+
		:> o
		3 * rwx 0x00002450 blah

		0x0040070a]> wa mov dword [rbp-0x4], 0xdfa8fc77
		Failed to write  -----
		[0x0040070a]> oo+
		[0x0040070a]> wa mov dword [rbp-0x4], 0xdfa8fc77
		Written 7 byte(s) (mov dword [rbp-0x4], 0xdfa8fc77) = wx c745fc77fca8df
		[0x0040070a]> 


Seeking
https://radare.gitbooks.io/radare2book/basic_commands/seeking.html
	Purpose 
		Seek to a different place by changing the current offset-- used in conjunction with pd
	
	Examples 
		Print current address:
			s
		Seek to an address:
			 s 0x0040070a

Print Modes
https://radare.gitbooks.io/radare2book/basic_commands/print_modes.html
	Purpose 
		Display and interpret information
		Print information that was seeked 
	Examples
		pd[?] [sz] [a] [b]       disassemble N opcodes (pd) or N bytes (pD)
				

Writing Data
https://radare.gitbooks.io/radare2book/basic_commands/write.html
https://radare.gitbooks.io/radare2book/basic_commands/write.html
    Purpose

    Steps prior to writing data
        Neccisary to map the file first
	((slight confusion on when to map binary file or run radar2 in debug mode, either r2 -d or ood))
	https://github.com/radare/radare2/issues/5865

    Examples:
        Using wa operation: write opcode, separated by ';' 
		Writing the opcode mov from the current offset and moving a memory address into a variable
	            wa mov dword [rbp-0x4], 0xdfa8fc77
	
	
	
        	Overwriting bigger value with smaller value in mov operation
		https://github.com/PlatyPew/picoctf-2018-writeup/tree/master/Reversing/be-quick-or-be-dead-2
			0x0040074f      bff7030000     mov edi, 0x3f7 

			wa mov edi, 5 @ 0x0040074f
			Written 5 byte(s) (mov edi, 5) = wx bf05000000
		
			0x0040074f      bf05000000     mov edi, 5   		

	Using wx operation: write two intel nops (from wxfile or wxseek)	
	        Overwriting opcode to create nop sled
        	    	https://github.com/PlatyPew/picoctf-2018-writeup/tree/master/Reversing/be-quick-or-be-dead-2
            		write two intel nops
                	wx 9090909090 @ 0x0040087d
			Neccisary to check if invalid opcodes are not present in nopsled 



Registers: get and set the values of those registers 
https://radare.gitbooks.io/radare2book/debugger/registers.html
	Using dr operation: Print value and manipulate value of registers
	Examples 
		Moving RIP to a different address to modify flow of program 
			dr rip=0x0040075a

		Changing the value of a register 
			storing hex value into eax
				dr eax=0x2e8e4d99
